# Tea-Cup Loan System  
A mini project (hence the name) created as a way for me  to accustom myself to the practices of TDD, OOP, domain-driven design, & benchmarking and to have a hands-on experience with micro-services built & set-up by tech stacks of the following:  
 - [X] SpringBoot
 - [X] Postgres
 - [ ] JSON RPC
 - [ ] Cache
 - [ ] Docker and CI/CD - later on deployed on AWS

### An Overview
The app you'll be seeing is a dummy design of how I understand/imagine a loan system under the grand scheme, where simply put you have loan accounts making purchases, resulting in multiple payments that each of those loan account needs to complete.
With this simple requirement, I've decided to create 3 services, **accounts**, **purchases**, and **payments**.
